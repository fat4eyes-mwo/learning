Kubernetes is a cluster management tool, allows deployment, coordination and management of containers over multiple nodes

Terms
Pod/Container -> Basic working component of kubernetes. Basically just a set of docker containers (or just one docker container)
Deployment -> A specification for deploying a number of containers. Contains what containers to deploy, the number to deploy. Kubernetes automatically distributes the containers to the available nodes depending on the coontainer
Ingress -> Provides external access to the cluster (usually through an HTTP server)
Service -> Manages access to multiple (identical) pods as a single entity. Usually provides task assignment and load balancing to the pods that it manages  

Important commands:
kubeadm: used for initializing clusters and cluster nodes
	kubeadm init : creates a control plane (master node)
	kubeadm join : executed on worker node to join a cluster
kubectl: provides control operations for the cluster (resource management, diagnostic displays, etc)
